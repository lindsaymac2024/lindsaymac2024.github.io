  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>My name is Lindsay MacPherson I’m 28 yrs old. I took a program called Women’s Unlimited at NSCC, it’s a program where you try all the trades and technology courses to see what sparks your interest before making any commitments. After taking this course I fell in love with the I.T world it was a difficult decision as I loved all the classes I was fortunate  to try, I decided to pick programming.

  </p><p>
    A few fun facts about myself is I’m originally from Toronto, I’m a licensed esthetician which I currently do as a side job, I have a 2 year old son and I’m a very outgoing person who loves to socialize.

<div id="para3">
  <div class="imgg"> <img  src="pictureofMOI.jpeg" alt="picture of me"></div><div class="backpara">
<p>In the future I would like to work with a company/business that allows me to do a various of things instead of focusing mainly on one individual task every day. Having great co-workers that I can get along with is also very important to me. The people you surround yourself with daily effects your work tremendously. I would like a job that I can learn from and improve my skills and knowledge to become a better version of me every day. I want to be able to grow in the company I choose to work for and be able to bring things to the table to help improve their work and overall business. Over all I know the future hold’s big things for me.</p>
